		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="nubble.jpg" style="width:240px;height:215px;">
		<p> My name is Sam and I am from a small tourist town in southern Maine called York. York is known for its historical attractions and also its four different beaches in town. I have spent my whole life in York and I plan on staying there for as long as I can. Both of my parents have lived in Maine their whole life and my Dad has lived in York his whole life just like me. I love baseball and cars but I will get more into those on my other pages.</p>
