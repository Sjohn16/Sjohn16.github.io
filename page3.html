		<p> I have played and followed baseball for my whole life. I'm a huge Red Sox fan and have been to many games. I have played baseball for as long as I can remember. When I was a freshman in high school we won the state championship, the first one in 42 years for our high school. I made two all star teams during high school and was all-state for three years. I still play for the Maine club baseball team and I have a lot of fun and it's still very competitive. </p>
