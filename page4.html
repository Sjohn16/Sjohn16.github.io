		<p> The only thing that I enjoy more than baseball is cars. I grew up around cars and learned a lot from my grandfather. He recently sold his '63 Ford Falcon Sprint convertible which was the car that got me started with it all. One of my favorite things to do is to go to a local cars and coffee event and see all the great cars around town and talk to all of the owners. I hope one day soon i'll be bringing my own car there.</p>
